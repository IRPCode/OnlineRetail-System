This is a program that shows how a linked list can be used inside of a Java application.

The program runs, and asks the end user if they would like to select a number from one through three.
Option one allows for the user to go through a process that adds a customer's name, order ID, and order total to the linked list.
Option two allows for the user to select an order ID to remove a customer from the linked list. 
Option three allows the user to print out the results of the database, and terminate the program.

Here is an example of the program running:
